# Demiurge Manual

Demiurge is a Python agent framework for building self-evolving agents.
Independent Agent Cores carry identity and boundaries, while modular design and
capability package management make tools, IO, skills, and child cores
installable, composable, and iterative.

The host owns the runtime loop, provider calls, tools, approvals, state,
delivery, promotion, and rollback. Capability evolution stays inside this clear
runtime boundary.

This manual is organized as a production tool guide. Start with a running
agent, then learn the host/core boundary, then author modules and operate the
runtime safely.

## Start Here

| Goal | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Install and run the fake provider | [getting-started/quickstart.md](getting-started/quickstart.md) |
| Configure a real model provider | [getting-started/configure-provider.md](getting-started/configure-provider.md) |
| Understand what the host owns | [concepts/host-and-agent-core.md](concepts/host-and-agent-core.md) |
| Customize an agent core | [authoring/agent-core-layout.md](authoring/agent-core-layout.md) |
| Diagnose runtime drift | [getting-started/update-and-doctor.md](getting-started/update-and-doctor.md) |

## Learning Path

1. Run `scripts/install.sh` or `uv run demiurge --provider fake`.
2. Read the host/core boundary before editing runtime cores.
3. Add one input module and one output module.
4. Install a package into a runtime core and inspect the changes.
5. Configure approvals, workspace scope, and external channels only after local TUI works.

## Short Path

```bash
uv run demiurge init
uv run demiurge --provider fake
```

For a real model, use an OpenAI-compatible endpoint and keep secrets in
environment variables:

```bash
export DEMIURGE_MODEL_NAME="gpt-4.1-mini"
export DEMIURGE_API_KEY="..."
uv run demiurge --provider openai
```

The default local entry is the TUI. External channels are started with:

```bash
uv run demiurge gateway --core assistant
```
